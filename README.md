# TheWeather
<p>A basic weather application with additional features such as user defined <strong>maxTemperature</strong> and <strong>maxHumidity</strong>.<br/>
The temperature and the humidity are then color-coded in the search results according to user's input.<br/>
The search is based on the <strong>city-name</strong> primarily.<br/>
The search results show the <strong>country-name</strong> of the city automatically.</p>

Also has basic error call backs. 
Such as, if the user did not input a city name, it throws an error (but a pretty one).</br>
Also, if the user entered a wrong city name, an error is displayed.
